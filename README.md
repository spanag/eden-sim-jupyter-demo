# EDEN - NeuroML - Jupyter Live Demonstration

EDEN is a novel high-usability, high-performance simulator for spiking neural networks. It supports all kinds of neural networks expressed in [NeuroML v2](https://neuroml.org/neuromlv2), whether they contained biophysically-modelled neurons, or artificial ones.

This repository contains a Jupyter notebook explaining how to use EDEN (and optionally pyNeuroML) to run NeuroML simulations, and contains neural network examples gathered from [NeuroML-DB](https://neuroml-db.org/).

It can be loaded and interacted with live, on Binder: [![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://binder.mybinder.ovh/v2/gh/spanag/eden-sim-jupyter-demo/master?filepath=Eden_Demo.ipynb)
